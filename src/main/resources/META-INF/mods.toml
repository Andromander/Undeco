The simple things in life, now made more simple.
Ornamental: Unusually Decorative is the child of the original Ornamental mod. The difference: Undeco is designed to cover simple or basic materials, rather than the weird materials.
See new materials such as Logs, Stone, Planks, and anything else that you might not know that you want, but this time it's something you expect to use.
